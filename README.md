# Record Linkage Workflow

This Jupyter notebook provides insights into a workflow designed for record linkage tasks. Record linkage is a crucial step in data preprocessing, especially when working with datasets that originate from different sources or require deduplication and matching of records based on certain criteria.

This notebook serves as a resource for individuals or teams working on data integration projects, focusing on the nuanced aspects of record linkage. It's designed to provide guidance on next steps after preliminary linkage efforts and strategies for managing difficult cases in record linkage tasks.

For detailed understanding and application, users are encouraged to review the notebook's code which contain specific examples tailored to record linkage.
